## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned more of flexbox.
- I also put more into practice of javascript.

- I also learned how to draw a shape i.e a circle using css;

```css
.circle {
    width: 145px;
    height: 145px;
    margin: 30px auto;
    shape-outside: circle();
    clip-path: circle();
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, var(--violetBlue), 30%,var(--persianBlue));
    padding-top: 10px;
    
}
```



### Continued development

- I look forward to furthering flexbox.
- And how does one style the border-left-top corner of a div just like in the design?

### Useful resources
